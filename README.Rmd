## Simple ts Function (stsfunctions)

This is a set of simple functions for time series objects commonly used in basic analysis and things.

## Function Reference

You can include R code in the document as follows

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
